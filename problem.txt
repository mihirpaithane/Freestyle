MAIN PROBLEM:
Design and implement an algorithm that reads in the files and selects what drinks and foods you should purchase within your budget based on the information in the files. Be creative in how you optimize food and drinks based on preferences.

- You are planning a party for an arbitrary number of people and you need to buy drinks and food.
- Assume youâ€™re given a budget (integer) and 3 files: people.txt, drinks.txt, food.txt
- people.txt contains an arbitrary number of people with their preferred drinks and food; each entry will be 3 lines long (1st line: name (not unique), 2nd line: drinks (comma delimited, not sorted), 3rd line: food (comma delimited, not sorted).	
- drinks.txt and food.txt are arbitrarily large and each entry will be 1 line long in the following format: <drink or food name>:unit cost
- Your answer should include an explanation of your algorithm, test cases, and a statement of all the assumptions you made.
In case of Not Solvable:
	(1) Meet drink needs
	(2) Meet food needs
Possible solutions: (Needed more constraints)
	OptaPlanner
	Knapsack

- Feel free to use any data structures and packages or create your own. Submit all your files in a zipped directory.
